            In 2019, I spent a few months learning a nanodegree of Data Analysis from Udacity and a Learn-To-Program
            certificate from University of Toronto, in which Python is the main coding language that I studied along
            with SQL and Statistics. This time gave me a begining understanding of how software engineer redefine the
            cutting-edge technology oriented world. With this little background of coding, I decided to pursue a further
            dream of becoming a full stack developer by learning C++, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, VUE and REACT.
